# python_word_document
This Word document has been entirely reproduced on Python, whose inputs were gathered from both an Excel and PDF document being also put into this repository. The idea is to create a template free for everyone, so that people interested in has no need of saving data to be sent towards Word, but can create their all-in-one reports, as can be done with Latex.

Next steps to be carried out are:

- Cross-referencing figures and tables
- Add references (books, journals, etc)
- Create figures from tables originated inside another source code to be called by the main one.
- Save the final version as PDF for more prolixity. 

Authors of the Excel and PDF files:  Anastasiya Poyda Oleksyuk and Ra√∫l Navarro Pedro
Author of the Python Doc: Brenda Rojas Delgado
